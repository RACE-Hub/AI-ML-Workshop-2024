    "# Experimenting Prompt Engineering - Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore common prompt engineering techniques to get the most out of Large Language Models (LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "First you will experiment by loading a 7 billion parameter LLM within the notebook environment and throwing some prompts its way to see how differt prompt strategies can impact the results of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "After trying different prompt engineering techniques, you will learn how to run a simple chatbot using what you learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll review some pointers for how to put these concepts into practice by building on the sample code and swapping in different LLMs to create your own solutions.\n",

    "First, if needed, install `ctransformers` - Python bindings implemented in C/C++ to accelerate the inference speed of models built on [`transformers` library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). If you run this notebook locally or on a GPU instance (ex. g4 or g5) instead of Studio Lab, please check that appropriate version of the CUDA runtime (`nvcc`) is installed. If you face a \"command not found\" error when running `nvcc`, [installing cuda-toolkit](https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cuda-toolkit) after checking which CUDA version is needed via `nvidia-smi` should fix the issue."

    "# What is Fine tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "When interacting with large lanauge models, you can enhance the model performance through fine tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruction tuning is a type of fine-tuning. We should be careful with the term \"fine-tuning\" because it encompasses many types of training in large language model context. For example, continued pre-training is another type of fine-tuning that aims to add additional knowledge beyond the base model. Training on domain-specific corpora such as medical articles, social media texts, and specific language data are examples. In contrast, instruction tuning aims to refine model behavior rather than adding knowledge. As a result of instruction tuning, a model can produce accurate responses with short or formatted prompts. It just like adding call-and-response style to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research enables \"switching\" model style by switching additional model weights to base model. [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) is one way to freeze original model weights and fine-tune with additional weights. For examples, you can generate artworks in different styles by switching LoRA model weights of Stable Diffusion. We can find various weights online such as [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/). (However we should be mindful of copyright - in most cases, emulating specific author's style and damaging their repuration or opportunities is forbidden by law.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fine tuning\", which includes both instruction tuning and continued pre-training, requires datasets, computing resources, and extensive training time and effort. We have confirmed that we can change the behavior by chainging only the prompt. This is called \"Prompt tuning\". We need to consider the most appropriate ways to elicit the desired responses from large language models. The course \"[Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)\" from DeepLearning.AI provides helpful guide for this decision.\n",

The mistral winds create upwelling, which brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface, providing a plentiful food source for the super-orcas. Additionally, the strong winds help to create waves that can aid in hunting and playing.
